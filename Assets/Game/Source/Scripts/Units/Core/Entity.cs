// Description: An entity is anything that is considered "alive" in the game. So, this is for player and enemy units.
//              By default, all entities are pushable and damagable, have health and methods for moving around on the grid.
//
//              Note: While all entities will have a health instance, it will not be instanciated by default. This is because
//              entities like the enemies will set up their health parameters a different way than say the player.
